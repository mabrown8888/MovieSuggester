# My-Movie-App
A movie web app that pulls movie details from a source and compiles them into a csv where I then use pytorch and machine learning to suggest movies for users.

Steps to implement:
- download all of the requirements listed in requirement.txt
- then run python app.py in terminal and hit the button to upload movies
- After this is done running (will take a while) run python train.py then run python app.py again and it's fully functional
